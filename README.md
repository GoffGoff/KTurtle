# KTurtle
KTurtle samples for education purposes

KTurtle is an educational programming environment for turtle graphics. 
KTurtle has a built-in programming language that is loosely based on the Logo programming language. 
It includes some basic elements, like variables, loops, ifs, includes some functions like sin or mod, and commands to control the turtle. 
It does not support arrays. 
The KTurtle language and IDE are limited to teaching programming using turtle graphics, and is not intended for other applications. 

Here are some projects i did with my doughter to bring her some basics in programming.

Dice is a virtual tool to play Yahtzee (in Germany - Kniffel, in Russia - pocker with dices). It simulates a set of 5 dices to play this game.

Clock is as set of working, animated clocks

Snake is an animated couple of snakes (or worms) moving randomly around and playing with each other.
