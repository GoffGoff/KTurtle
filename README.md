# KTurtle
KTurtle samples for education purposes.

KTurtle is an educational programming environment for turtle graphics. 
KTurtle has a built-in programming language that is loosely based on the Logo programming language. 
It includes some basic elements, like variables, loops, ifs, includes some functions like sin or mod, and commands to control the turtle. 
It does not support arrays. 
The KTurtle language and IDE are limited to teaching programming using turtle graphics, and is not intended for other applications. 

Here are some projects i've done with my doughter to bring her some basics in programming.

To run this samples you need to download files with .turtle extension, open it in KTurtle and run with maximal speed.

"Dice" is a virtual tool to play Yahtzee (in Germany - Kniffel, in Russia - покер на костях, Tali in GNOME Games). It just simulates a set of 5 dices and lets a player to roll and reroll dices. Learning points: subroutines, functions, user interaction.

"Clock" is as set of working, animated clocks. Looks nice)) Learning points: animation, loops, nested loops, subroutines. And unorthodox approach generally.

"Snake" is an animated couple of snakes (or worms) moving randomly around and playing with each other. Learning points: unorthodox approach, animation, physical modelling, AI. Read Snake/README.md
