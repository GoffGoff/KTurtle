KTurtle samples for education purposes.

Set "Clock"

1. clock_first_stage.turtle is a first approach. Let KTurtle draws a clock. Clock is a good object to explain subroutines and loops.

2. clock_second_hand.turtle is a next stage - make clock running. Now we use nested loops and subroutines to run (animate) the clock.

3. clock_studio_style.turtle - make clock even better. Improved version.

Open file in KTurtle and run it at maximal speed
